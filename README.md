# Creative Coding

![](icon.jpg)

Creative code library and examples create with [Haxe](http://www.haxe.org) (currently only JavaScript target). Do you want to know more about this beautiful programming language: [README_HAXE.MD](README_HAXE.MD)!

Most of my library code is inspired or based upon the work of George Gally, Seb Lee-Delisle, Matt DesLauriers (and probably many more) but they used a dynamic language (JavaScript) for . I want to So my start is a little bit slow converting everything to Haxe; a strictly typed language, but in the end this will help me to work faster.

You can seen my progress on this page: <https://matthijskamstra.github.io/creative-coding/>.

But if you don't want to see animations, and mouse interactions: I have created a [gallery](GALLERY.md) document.

This is not my first attempt, so if you want to check out my previous attempt: <http://matthijskamstra.github.io/gen-art/>. This attempt was to create pattern in `.svg`.

## Inspiration

After reading the article of [George Gally](https://hackernoon.com/creative-coding-basics-4d623af1c647) it got me thinking.
Yes, I liked the way Flash worked as well. And all the stuff that Flash can do, modern browsers can do as wel.

So why not give it a try...

## Color

I want to create mostly in black and white. But colours will be nice.
To make sure it will not cost too much time, I will be using:

- heavy lifting with colours I will be doing via `thx.color` or `hxColorToolkit`
- ColorUtil class
- <https://github.com/mattdesl/nice-color-palettes>


## libs

This is Haxe specific, its just here FYI

-lib hxquicksettings
-lib thx.color
-lib hxColorToolkit
-lib msignal
-lib mloader
-lib uglifyjs

## WIP

I am focusing on getting it to work on Chrome... just giving you a heads-up!
And I am not concerned with optimisation: you fan will sometimes spike!

## TODO

I have created a [TODO.MD](TODO.MD), that keeps me in my IDE and helps structure progress.

Important stuff:

- [x] start lib
- [x] add animation engine
- [x] create navigation for sketches
