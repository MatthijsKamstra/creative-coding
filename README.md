# Creative Coding

![](icon.jpg)

Creative code with [Haxe](http://www.haxe.org) (currently only JavaScript target). Do you want to know more about this beautiful programming language: [README_HAXE.MD](README_HAXE.MD)!

Most work is inspired by George Gally, Seb Lee-Delisle, Matt DesLauriers (and probably many more) but in a dynamic language. So my start is a little bit slow converting everything to Haxe a stricly typed language, but in the end this will help me to work faster.

You can seen my progress on this page: <https://matthijskamstra.github.io/creative-coding/>.

This is not my first attempt, so if you want to check out my previous attempt: <http://matthijskamstra.github.io/gen-art/>. This attempt was to create pattern in svg.

## Inspiration

After reading the article of [George Gally](https://hackernoon.com/creative-coding-basics-4d623af1c647) it got me thinking.
Yes, I liked the way Flash worked as well. And all the stuff that Flash can do, modern browsers can do as wel.

So why not give it a try...
